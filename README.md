## Glossary
| Vocabulary | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| API (Application Programming Interface) | API allows interaction with others' software using your own code. For my basic algorithmic trading projects, I use GET requests to gather data from IEX Cloud API. |
| POST | POST adds data to the database exposed by the API. (Create only) |
| PUT | PUT adds **and overwrites** data in the database exposed by the API. (Create or replace) |
| DELETE | DELETE deletes data from the API's database. |
| Pair Trading (Pairs Trade) | Pair trading is a market neutral trading strategy enabling traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement. This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy. |
| Risk Parity | Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy that uses risk to determine allocations across various components of an investment portfolio. The risk parity strategy modifies the modern portfolio theory (MPT) approach to investing through the use of leverage. |
| Seasonality Effect | The stock market is subject to seasonal stock trends that at certain times of the year, month or even week, share prices can rise or fall. This can be because of changes in the number of traders active in the market or because technical analysis has made historical price patterns more 'self-fulfilling.' |
