# Notes on Algorithmic Trading

## Quantitative Analysis

Quantitative analysis is applied to measure and assess efficiency and value of financial tools as well as to predict future events, i.e., change in stock profitability.

Quantitative analysis involves building computerized trading models and aids investors in assessing investment opportunities as well as in developing the most successful trading strategy and investing basket.

The main difference between quantitatve analysis and technical analysis is that quantitative analysts do not focus on what the market will be like in the future. Rather, quantitative analysts try to develop a trading and investing strategy that can be quantified.

| Vocabulary | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| API (Application Programming Interface) | API allows interaction with others' software using your own code. For my basic algorithmic trading projects, I use GET requests to gather data from IEX Cloud API. |
| POST | POST adds data to the database exposed by the API. (Create only) |
| PUT | PUT adds **and overwrites** data in the database exposed by the API. (Create or replace) |
| DELETE | DELETE deletes data from the API's database. |
| Pair Trading (Pairs Trade) | Pair trading is a market neutral trading strategy enabling traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement. This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy. |
| Risk Parity | Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy that uses risk to determine allocations across various components of an investment portfolio. The risk parity strategy modifies the modern portfolio theory (MPT) approach to investing through the use of leverage. |
| Seasonality Effect | The stock market is subject to seasonal stock trends that at certain times of the year, month or even week, share prices can rise or fall. This can be because of changes in the number of traders active in the market or because technical analysis has made historical price patterns more 'self-fulfilling.' |
| Basket Investing | A basket is a collection of multiple securities (e.g., stocks, currencies, etc.) which have a similar theme or share certain criteria. For instance, a sector exchange traded fund (ETF) may contain a basket of stocks that are all in the same industry. |
| Hedge Fund | A hedge fund is a pooled investment fund that trades in relatively liquid assets and is able to make extensive use of more complex trading, portfolio-construction, and risk management techniques in an attempt to improve performance, such as short selling, leverage, and derivatives. Put simply, a hedge fund is a private investment partnership and funds pool that uses varied and complex proprietary strategies and invests or trades in complex products, including listed and unlisted derivatives. |
| Renaissance Technologies LLC | Renaissance Technologies LLC, also known as RenTech or RenTec, is an American hedge fund based in East Setauket, New York, on Long Island, which specializes in systematic trading using quantitative models derived from mathematical and statistical analysis. |
| EBITDA | EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of a company's overall financial performance and is used as an alternative to net income in some circumstances. |
| Quantitative Analysis (QA) | QA is a technique that uses mathematical and statistical modeling, measurement, and research to understand behavior. Quantitative analysts represent a given reality in terms of a numerical value. |
